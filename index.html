		<p>I love the month June. I'm born that month, and it's in the middle of summer. There are so many things you are able to do in this month including, go to the aquarium, go to the amusement park, go swimming, go to the beach, travelling, going in a hot air balloon, hiking mountains, going to concerts, go fishing, go shopping, watch fireworks, and go biking. These are great things that you can do in many months, but are best to do in a summery time like June.</p>
